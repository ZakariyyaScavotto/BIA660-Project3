        "\n",
        "You have been hired as a Data Scientist at Low Risk Capital Management (LRCM), a quantitative hedge fund managing $15 billion in assets. Professor Low, the fund's founder and CIO, has identified a critical limitation in the firm's investment strategy. The traditional sector classifications (GICS, BICS) are increasingly outdated for capturing the nuances of modern technology companies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Professor Low explains the challenge: \"A company like Microsoft is classified as 'Software & Services,' but that tells us nothing about their quantum computing research, AI infrastructure, or nuclear power investments for data centers. Tesla is 'Consumer Discretionary,' yet they're developing humanoid robots and autonomous AI. We're missing massive investment opportunities because we're using 20th-century classifications for 21st-century companies.\"\n",

        "* Identify companies involved in emerging technologies regardless of official sector classification  \n",
        "* Create semantic search capabilities for finding investment opportunities in specific themes  \n",

        "\n",
        "Before you begin Part 1, you must understand the expectations for this project.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **On ChatGPT and AI Assistants:** This project is designed to test your understanding. With generative AI, writing the initial code for a step might take 3 minutes, but debugging it will take 3 days when used incorrectly (e.g. pasting the entire template into ChatGPT and then submitting as your work without thought). **You will not be given debugging support for code you do not understand.** The feedback for non-functional or misunderstood AI-generated code will be simple: \"The student must understand and debug their own code.\" Use these tools as a partner, not a crutch.  \n",
        "2. **Modular, Self-Healing Code:** You are building a data engineering pipeline. Your code *will* fail. A webpage will break, an API will rate-limit you, and a company name will be ambiguous. Your code must be **modular and self-healing**. You will do this by using MongoDB as your pipeline's \"state.\" Instead of running one *monolithic* script that fails and loses all progress, you will build a *process* that runs in stages. This can be in a single notebook (running cells in sequence) or as separate, modular scripts. You will run multiple passes, updating a status field (e.g., wiki_resolver) in MongoDB. This allows you to fix a bug and re-run your code, which \"heals\" the data by picking up where it left off.  \n",
        "3. **Submission Artifacts:** This is a data project. The code is only one artifact. Your **MongoDB database** is the primary deliverable. For grading and verification, you **must submit your MongoDB connection URI** (with a read-only user) along with your code.\n"

        "Objective  \n",
        "Create a comprehensive, multi-source data warehouse in MongoDB. This process must be modular, iterative, and \"self-healing,\" allowing it to be re-run without data loss.\n",

        "\n",
        "You will not build one monolithic script. You will build a process that \"heals\" your database. The core logic is:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialize:** Load all IWB tickers into MongoDB.  \n",
        "2. **Iterate:** Write code (e.g., Pass 1\\) that finds all documents `{\"wiki_resolver\": {\"$exists\": False}}`.  \n",
        "3. **Process:** Attempt to fetch data for those documents.  \n",
        "4. **Update:** If successful, update\\_one the document with `{\"$set\": {\"wiki_content\": ..., \"wiki_resolver\": \"wikipedia\"}}`.  \n",
        "5. **Repeat:** Your next pass (e.g., Pass 2\\) runs the *same* todo_df query, finding only the documents that Pass 1 *failed* to resolve. It's a \"self-healing\" loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **1.2 Structured Data Collection (IWB Holdings)**\n",

        "  * Filter for valid US tickers (1-4 letters, no spaces/dashes).  \n",
        "  * Drop unnecessary columns.  \n",
        "  * Standardize column names (lowercase, underscores).  \n",
        "  * **Ticker Mapping:** You MUST handle special tickers. Map the IWB A/B share tickers (e.g., BRKB, BFB) to their **dot format** equivalents (e.g., BRK.B, BF.B). This is critical for the Wikipedia vCard validation step.  \n",
        "\n",

        "  * Use wikipedia.search() to find the most likely page.  \n",
        "  * Use wikipedia.page() to get the page object.  \n",
        "  * Use BeautifulSoup to parse the vCard (infobox).  \n",
        "  * Use regex to clean both the vCard (\\\\xa0) and the main page.content (remove citations, \"See Also,\" \"References,\" etc.).  \n",
        "  * **Validation:** Perform a check to ensure the ticker (in its dot format) is in the vcard\\_dict.get('Traded as', '').  \n",

        "\n",
        "Pass 2: Fallback Resolver (Bing \\+ Selenium)  \n",
        "Objective: Resolve remaining companies that the wikipedia library's search failed to find (e.g., ambiguous names).\n",

        "* **Process:** For this new todo_df, use a different strategy.  \n",
        "  * Use selenium to search Bing (e.g., `search_bing(f'{tickerexch} {company_name} Company Wikipedia')`).  \n",
        "  * Parse the Bing results to find the most likely Wikipedia URL.  \n",
        "  * Pass this url to your *existing* data-fetching function from Pass 1, which can now accept a URL.  \n",

        "  * **Handle ticker formats:** The yfinance library often expects *dash* formats (e.g., BRK-B) for tickers that your database now has in *dot* format (e.g., BRK.B). You will need to convert them (e.g., row.ticker.replace('.','-')).  \n",
        "  * Use the longBusinessSummary as the wiki_content for this document.  \n",
        "  * Extract a subset of the yftic.info object (e.g., address1, city, website, industry, sector) to serve as the wiki_vcard.  \n",

        "* **The Solution:** You must run a separate DQ check to find mismatched data. A robust method is to query MongoDB directly. For example, you can write a query that checks if the **first word** of the company's name (after removing punctuation) can be found *anywhere* in the wiki_content (also with punctuation removed). This is a powerful heuristic to find pages that are clearly about the wrong topic.  \n",
        "* The \"Heal\": For any documents that fail this DQ check, you must \"unset\" the wiki_resolver field. This marks them as \"to-do\" again, and your pipeline will automatically try to re-resolve them in the next run (e.g., with the Bing or yfinance pass).  \n",

        "\n",
        "At the end of Part 1, you should have >98% coverage for your IWB universe, with each document tagged by the resolver method that succeeded. For reference, here is what I acheived\n",

        "Summarization is the task of distilling a long piece of text into a short, coherent version that captures the most critical information.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you ask an LLM to \"summarize,\" it uses its training to predict a sequence of words (tokens) that represents a compressed version of the input. For our project, we don't want a generic summary; we want an **extractive summary** focused on *investable themes*—business strategy, new products, key industries, and competitive advantages.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **The Problem: The Stated vs. Practical Context Limit**\n",
        "\n",
        "You will immediately hit a major roadblock: the **Context Limit** (or context window).\n",
        "\n",
        "An LLM cannot \"read\" an infinitely long document. It can only process a fixed number of tokens at one time. You can find the *stated* limit for a model easily. For example, using `ollama`:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "But a model's *stated* limit is not its *practical* limit. **Think of it like a sports car's speedometer that reads 250 mph. The car can't *actually* reach that speed in real-world conditions.**\n",
        "\n",
        "The stated limit (e.g., 32,768 tokens) is a theoretical maximum. The *practical* limit—the amount of text it can *actually* pay attention to and reason over, especially for a complex task like summarization—is much, much lower.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Your First Task: Testing the Practical Limit**\n",
        "\n",
        "You **must** test this for yourself. You cannot trust the documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Write a test script that takes a long document (e.g., `WMT`'s `wiki_content`) and sends *chunks of increasing size* (e.g., 100 words, 500, 1000, 2000...) to the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your prompt should ask the model to return a **JSON object** that proves it read the *entire* chunk.\n",

        "When I ran this test, I found the model *claimed* a 32k token limit, but it started failing to see the full document at around **1500-2000 words**.\n",

For our pipeline, this is not a feasible or scalable solution.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Objective:** Enrich every document in your MongoDB collection with a new, structured summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tooling:** You may use any LLM you wish (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic). However, I strongly recommend you use a local model runner like **`ollama`** with a high-performance Small Language Model (SLM) like **`gemma3n:e2b`** or **`gemma3n:e4b`**. This is free, private, and incredibly fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **1. The Solution: The \"MapReduce\" Workflow**\n",
        "\n",
        "The only robust, economical, and reliable solution is a multi-step \"chunk and synthesize\" process, often called MapReduce:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Chunk:** First, you must write a function to split the long `wiki_content` into smaller, overlapping chunks. Based on our test, a chunk size of **1500 words** with a 100-word overlap is a safe and effective choice. (See **get_simple_chunks** in Extra Credit 2.3 below)\n",
        "2.  **\"Map\" Step:** You iterate through each chunk and send it to an LLM with a specific prompt (e.g., \"You are an equity analyst. Extract 1-3 material key points from this text.\"). You collect the results from *all* chunks.\n",
        "3.  **\"Reduce\" Step:** You now have a new, much shorter document (e.g., a list of key points). You pass *this* document to the LLM a *second time* with a different prompt (e.g., \"You are a senior portfolio manager. Synthesize these key points into a final investment summary.\").\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, our **16,243-word `WMT` article** will be split into **12 chunks**. The \"Map\" step will process all 12, generating **\\~24 key points**. The \"Reduce\" step will then synthesize *only* these 24 points into the final, concise summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **2. The Self-Healing Query**\n",
        "\n",
        "Your script must be modular. It should *only* process documents that need work. You will query MongoDB for all documents where a summary field (e.g., `SUMMARY_material_points`) **does not exist.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hint:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Query for documents that have NOT been summarized yet\n",
        "todo_cursor = collection.find({\n",

        "\n",
        "The term \"sparse\" comes from how the data is represented. Imagine a massive spreadsheet where:\n",
        "- Each row is a document\n",
        "- Each column is a unique word in your entire corpus (potentially 100,000+ columns)\n",
        "- Each cell contains the frequency of that word in that document\n",

        "\n",
        "The foundation of sparse search is **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Term Frequency (TF):** How often does \"quantum\" appear in this document?\n",
        "   - If a document mentions \"quantum\" 10 times, it's probably about quantum computing\n",

        "2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):** How rare is \"quantum\" across all documents?\n",

        "\n",
        "  * **Step 3: Prompt Engineering for Classification:**\n",
        "    This is the most important prompt of the project. You must force the LLM to act as a skeptical analyst.\n",
        "\n",

        "      * **Task:** \"Classify this company into one of three categories: `core`, `secondary`, or `not_relevant`.\"\n",
        "      * **Definitions:** You must strictly define these terms:\n",
        "          * `core`: The company's primary business *is* the theme (e.g., `NVDA` for 'AI Chips').\n",
        "          * `secondary`: A key *beneficiary* or *enabler* (e.g., a SaaS company for 'Cloud Computing').\n",
        "          * `not_relevant`: A *user* of the technology (e.g., `MCD` for 'Cloud Computing') or an unrelated company.\n",
        "      * **Pydantic Schema:** You **must** use a Pydantic `BaseModel` (e.g., `DetermineTheme`) and the `format=` parameter in `ollama.chat()` to guarantee a clean JSON response.\n",
        "      * **Few-Shot Examples:** Your prompt *must* include the \"Few-Shot Examples\" from your code to teach the model how to be skeptical (e.g., classifying `GM` as `not_relevant` to 'Robotics' because it's a *user*, not a *provider*).\n",

        "      * **Semantic Ambiguity:** The LLM will confuse 'crypto mining' with 'copper mining' (e.g., `FCX`, `NEM`).\n",
        "      * **Overly Generous:** It might classify `BLK` (BlackRock) as `core` to crypto just because of their ETF, which is wrong. They are not crypto *infrastructure*.\n",

        "5.  **Bonus:** You can also calculate the synthetic `Open`, `High`, and `Low` for the portfolio by averaging the *ratios* (e.g., `(Open/Close).mean(axis=1)`) and multiplying by your cumulative `Close`.\n",

        "    * You must submit a video recording (e.Small, clear video presentation) in which all team members participate.\n",
        "    * **All members must have their cameras on** and must **state their full name** before their speaking portion.\n",
        "    * Each member must have **roughly equal speaking time** and demonstrate their understanding of the *entire* pipeline, not just their assigned part.\n",
        "    * The video must include a **live demonstration** of your system, including:\n",
        "        * Querying your live MongoDB database.\n",
        "        * Running your hybrid search (Part 4).\n",

        "2.  **The Live Data Warehouse:**\n",

        "    * **If I cannot connect, I cannot grade.**\n",
        "    * I will be verifying the full data lifecycle: correct schemas, resolver tags, summary fields, embedding arrays, and the final `production_embedding`.\n",

        "    * All Python code (.py files or clean, runnable Jupyter notebooks) for all 5 parts.\n",
        "    * The code must be \"self-healing.\" I will test this by deleting data (e.g., `SUMMARY_` fields from 10 documents) and re-running your scripts. The pipeline must *only* heal the missing data and not re-process the entire database.\n",
        "\n",

        "    * **`search_evaluation_scoreboard.csv`:** An export of your Part 4 search evaluation (Precision@10 & RR@10).\n",
        "    * **`final_thematic_baskets.csv`:** Your final, human-verified `core_thematic_df` from Part 5. This is your final set of ticker recommendations and reasoning.\n",
